This is the fifth incarnation of my home page, and just about the only
place on the internet, that still uses underlined links. This is not
hardcore, this is just simple manageable CSS, and HTML mostly. 

I have been stubborn enough to build my own static blog engine around it, in 
python. I have done this, to get things working the way I wanted rather than 
conform, no matter the fact that it would have been, in many ways, easier to use 
a static blog engine among the many fine once on the net.

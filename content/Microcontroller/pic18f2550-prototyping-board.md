title: PIC18F2550 prototyping board
type: post

I have just finished testing a prototyping board I have designed for the
PIC18F2550, that I will be using in a project I am doing for a friend.
The board is designed to interface with the [PICKit
2](http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en023805),
programmer/debugger, has an on board 5 Volt regulator, and pads for a
serial port through the
[MAX232](http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1798) line
driver/receiver. This is not rocket science, just a nice PIC18F2550 to
breadboard converter.

title: PIC18F4550 USB ICSP breakout board
type: post
template: post

I have some PIC18F4550s lying around, and I want to play with the USB
features of this chip, therefore I made this breakout board. It contains
enough components to get the PICMicro running, and nothing more, all the
pins are routed to pin-headers to use with an experimenter board.

Features:

-   ICSP connector (In-Circuit Serial Programming, AKA PicKit 2 & 3)
-   USB-B Connector
-   20Mhz clock crystal

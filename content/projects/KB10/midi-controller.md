As I have mentioned, I am building a MIDI controller using the
PIC18F4550. The controller has a MIDI in port, and acts as a MIDI to USB
converter as well.

Features:

-   10 potentiometers (knobs)
-   MIDI in
-   USB MIDI interface

Missing hardware:

-   Drill and mount the front panel
-   Create and mount the PCB
-   Mount the guts in the case

Missing firmware:

-   Active sense handling
-   MIDI channel selection

As always more details, source code, schematic, and PCB will follow.

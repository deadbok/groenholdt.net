Nice little horsee ;). Well this nice little horsee, and my daughter
teamed up to kill my TDA1543 DAC, that I had been stupid enough to leave
on the floor for a while during some tests. The heat sink on the 317
regulator was shorted to ground, while the horse had one of its feet
planted firmly inside the case. This led to some very disturbing
movements of the speaker cones, but everything except the DAC, seem to
have survived. I could probably resurrect it with a new regulator, the
TDA1543 chip has proven very sturdy, but I think it has had its time.
I'm going to build a new one using the TDA1545, because it simple, and
later I will upgrade to the [Wolfson
WM8740](http://www.wolfsonmicro.com/products/WM8740/).

*Yes it has always looked like this, no wonder my daugther didn't think
it was of value.*

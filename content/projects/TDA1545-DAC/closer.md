The TDA1545 DAC is nearing completion. I'm trying, for once, to make a
nice product, somewhat operational by a simple human being.
The DAC has gotten a new 5 channel input selector. This is basicly 5 SMD relays 
(mounted on the solderside), the
[CS8412]($LOCALURL/cs8412.pdf)
receiver, and a basic cap filtered PSU. The TDA1545 DAC board fits on
top, this way, when finished, everything is firmly attached to the
receiver board. I will post the PCB layout, and schematics, when the
last bugs have been squashed, and the values of some components have
been optimized.

Let me just say, that this is a big step for me, as it is the first of
my HIFI projects in 5 years, that is actually in feature freeze, and
will reach a final and generally usable state.

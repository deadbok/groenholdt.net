Damn that horse! I have spend much of the day building a TDA1545 version
of my DAC, but with no success. The CS8412 SPDIF -\> I2S/EIAJ converter
locks to the signal, but only noise comes out from the DAC. Maybe I will
have to resurrect the TDA1543 board, to make sure everything in front of
the DAC, still works.

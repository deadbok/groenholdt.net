As noted earlier, I had some trouble with C7 blowing the chips. I am no
closer to being sure what the problem was, but I am beginning to suspect
a bad batch of chips, anyhow the original value is according to Phlips
datasheet, way to high. I have now settled for a 2.2uF WIMA cap, and
everything is playing nicely.

I had some help with my troubles at
[diyhifi.org](http://www.diyhifi.org), the thread is here:

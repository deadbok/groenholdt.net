I have just finished mounting the ÂµC board, to test the firmware and,
after a little trimming, everything worked. The fact that the board
connects directly to the PICkit2 programmer, means that I can program it
, and test it while the thing is on. I have updated the code in the SVN,
to reflect the changes. All there is left, are three holes in the
front and oh I gotta put a lid on it.

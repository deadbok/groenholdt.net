!{Mounted PSU PCB}($LOCALURL/mounted-psu-pcb.jpg)

I started a thread on diyAudio,
[here](http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/power-supplies/169614-power-supply-my-laboratory-bench.html).
Some of the feedback, I got, made me revise the circuit, to accommodate
an off-board current limiting circuit. Along the way, I adjusted a
couple of things, and added current mirrors to the differential
amplifiers, since I could cram them in there, and they should better the
performance. I have designed and etched a PCB, and tested the positive
half of the circuit.

When testing is done, I will post the revised schematic, and PCB. Stay
tuned.

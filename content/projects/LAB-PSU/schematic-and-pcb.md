I have built and tested, the revised version of, both the positive, and
the tracking negative regulator. The new version is here:

<br style="clear: both;" />

I have not included Q12, since it was part of the original current
limiting circuit. The pass transistors Q5 and Q7, are mounted off-board,
on a suitable heat sink. R18 adjusts the maximum output voltage, and R17
adjusts the voltage of the negative tracking regulator.


I will do some more testing of the power supply under different load
conditions, and post the results.

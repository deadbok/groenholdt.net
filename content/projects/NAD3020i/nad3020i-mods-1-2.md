In the 3020i there a two thermal fuses (E401, E402) in the output
circuit, you can take these out if you are certain, that you will never
short circuit the output. On the earlier original model I believe this
protection is done using a relay, and an integrated circuit, I think you
will be able to rip out the relay in these versions.

I just ripped out these thermal fuses and replaced them with a piece of
SILVER (you have to shout that word to make sure it's stays audiophile)
wire, that my good friend [Peter](http://warholms.net) gave me.

I do believe this further cleaned up the bass output, of the thing, so
much that I will have to find means to reconnect my sub woofers soon.
This means that the bass output is now at "normal" and acceptable
levels. I'm not working at optimal listening conditions as a friend of
mine is playing Battlefield right beside me, but I do believe these
thermal fuses had a higher sonic impact, than I would have thought, then
maybe again it's the SILVER.

I just did some calculations on how much power the NAD will deliver in
class A into 8 Ohms, with a bias current of 100mA. It seems it is a
whooping 0,08W peak! I may try, over a period, increasing the bias
current to 500mA to give about 1W class A. I did add to the cooling
after all.

*Note: I tried upping the bias current to 250mA, but the heat sinks were
warmer than I liked, and I have backed down to 125mA.*

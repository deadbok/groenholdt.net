title: NAD3020i mod \#1
type: post


I replaced the PSU capacitors for the power amplifier (C508/C509) with
some 15000uF/50V parts I had salvaged somewhere else. This may be a
little overboard, since the value of the capacitors in the original may
very well, serve as protection against overheating the amp. The big idea
being, that as the current draw rises, as the amp is turned up, the
capacitors can not maintain their charge, thus lowering the supply
voltage to power amp (and adding distortion). There is a possibility,
that the amp can now overheat at high volumes, due to the larger
reserve.

While I had the amp opened, I adjusted the bias (idle current) as well I
upped it to 100mA, measuring 100mV across (R455/R456). This means the
amp delivers a little more power before leaving class A, and heats up a
bit more. I therefore added an extra heat sink, to the one already
installed.

The bass of the amp now sound more controlled, and thereby somewhat
less excessive, leaving a little more room for the midrange and treble
to shine. This is consistent with what others have heard, changing the
PSU capacitors. The increased bias current probably does not improve
things to the same degree as the capacitors, and I will not recommend
this mod unless you are prepared to keep an eye on the amp, checking it
is not overheating. But change those capacitors.

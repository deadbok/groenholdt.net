Another classic for my museum ;). The NAD 3020, praised for being a very
nice sounding amplifier, in its price range, back in 1981. I bought it
cheap on an auction, couldn't resist it. Though I haven't listened
intensively, the sound of this amplifier is indeed very nice. Since I
have only used the power amplifier, the following deals only with the
sound of that. My impression is that this amplifier has an astounding
ability, to make the music feel alive and to that extend has really good
imaging. The bass is a tad exaggerated to my taste, but then again I
have that feeling with a lot of HIFI components.

All in all this is a really nice amplifier, and due to the simplicity of
the circuit very mod-able. I won't regret the money I spend for a
nanosecond.

Build the last simulated version of the SE class a headamp today, on
breadboard. It works as an amplifier, it is class A, it is hot, and it
is oscillating. I have to read a little more about taming the beast, did
try some tricks, and it helped. Also I have to try some other
transistors in the output stage, I have two different brands of BD139. I
was unable to measure the hFE of the ones of which I have the most, even
though the other brand measures fine. Since this was a prototype, I used
the strange ones, maybe they are bad to the bone.

**NOTE:** I found this thread at diyaudio.com read through, it's really
nice stuff: [Pure Class A Single End Amplifier

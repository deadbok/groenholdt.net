It has been brought to my attention
[here](http://forum.audioplatinum.com/viewtopic.php?p=13544#p13544) that
my instruction for building the [Single ended class A
headamp]({filename}/single-ended-class-a-headamp-done.rst) is not
complete.

The transistors in the current mirror, and differential amplifier will
benefit from having thermal contact, to keep the temperature difference
as small as possible, thereby minimising the DC output offset. I have
taken the best picture I could, of this coupling for one channel, in my
amplifier.

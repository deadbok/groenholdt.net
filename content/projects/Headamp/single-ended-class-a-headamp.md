I have cooked this circuit up during the last couple of days, it is
single ended and borrows the output stage from the famous [John Linsley
Hood Class A amplifier](http://www.tcaas.btinternet.co.uk/). Distortion
figures and PSRR look quite nice, but the circuit has only been
simulated, I have a TDA1545 DAC to finish If I could only keep my
mind on a single project. If my calculations are correct, the amp will deliver 
250mW into a 32Ohms load in class A.

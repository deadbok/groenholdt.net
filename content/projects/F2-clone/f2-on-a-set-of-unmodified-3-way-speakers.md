title: F2 on a set of unmodified 3 way speakers
type: post


I tried playing the F2, through my ordinary 3-way speakers, just for
kicks. Well Nothing exploded. The sound was odd, but there was
something good hidden in there, though each speaker was running it's own
show. Most notably, was the total lack of control in the bass region, it
sounded somewhat like a boom box, with the bass boost button pressed
firmly in to the "maximum boost" position. I have a stereo set of servo
controlled sub woofers taking over from 90hz, and this arrangement
certainly didn't work like supposed, the sub woofers each have their own
amplifier, and therefore remained voltage driven.

I did a simulation to see what was going on, and here are the results:

Still there was something really good hidden behind the overwhelming
incoherence, makes me wonder

title: Installing an OpenWRT based webserver on the Medion OX820 based NAS 
type: post
template: post
status: hidden

After getting Gentoo to run on the Medion NAS in these posts,

 + [Medion OX820 based NAS and Gentoo]($LOCALURL../Gentoo/medion-0x820-based-nas/medion-ox820-based-nas.html)
 + [Medion NAS native kernel compile]($LOCALURL../Gentoo/medion-nas-native-kernel-compile.html)

I learned that [OpenWRT](http://openwrt.org) had been ported to the oxnas platform. This 
appealed to me, as OpenWRT is installed on the internal flash. Honestly
the Gentoo installation I had on the HDD, was better suited as a web
server, but I just wanted to play with OpenWRT. The only real reason for 
using OpenWRT instead of Gentoo, is in the hopes that the OpenWRT folks 
will keep the kernel updated.

I still have my web page, and the files from which it is generated, on
a hard disk drive, connected to the SATA port.

I recommend having a serial connection to the NAS running at all times.

Installing OpenWRT bootstrap.
=============================

This operation can only be executed once, and **may brick your device**,
after the bootstrap **there is no way to restore the original firmware**.
Because of this I can not actually check that these steps are exactly
right, but they are what i recall.

To bootstrap the installation I used the 
[binary image](https://gitorious.org/openwrt-oxnas/openwrt-oxnas-gitorious-wiki/archive/2e5653b2c09ed9dca988f89c68f44a61e3bdde19.tar.gz) 
from
[Gitorious openwrt-oxnas](https://gitorious.org/openwrt-oxnas/pages/install).

Setup a HTTP server on a computer to serve `openwrt-oxnas-stg212-u-boot-initramfs.itb`.
Telnet into the NAS using the backdoor described on 
 [mikrocontroller.net](http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/P89626#Telnet).
Login to the web-interface on the NAS, then open 
`http://(NAS IP)/r36807,/adv,/cgi-bin/remote_help-cgi?type=backdoor`
(you may have to replace the /rXXXXX,/ with the revision number shown 
in the URL after login).
The browser will wait for the CGI script to (never) end, while itâ€™s 
doing that telnet into the NAS. Login with user root and the password
also used by the web interface (default is 1234).

	telnet (NAS IP)

After logging in, download the OpenWRT image to `/tmp/tmpfs`. Look in
`/proc/mtd` and make sure `kernel` is in `/dev/mtd4`. Write the image
to `/dev/mtd4`, tell U-Boot to boot from it, and reboot. 

	cd /tmp/tmpfs wget http://(server IP)/openwrt-oxnas-stg212-u-boot-initramfs.itb
	cat /proc/mtd 
	nandwrite /dev/mtd4 openwrt-oxnas-stg212-u-boot-initramfs.itb 
	fw_setenv boot_stage2 nand read 64000000 440000 90000\\; go 64000000
	fw_setenv bootcmd run boot_stage2 reboot

This is where the serial connection comes in handy, for watching the
boot process. If everything went well LUCI, OpenWRT's web interface
should be available on the NAS on address 192.168.1.1. When you have
compiled a new OpenWRT image you can flash it, by using LUCI.

Compiling OpenWrt.
==================

Since, for now, oxnas support is only in OpenWRT trunk, everything needs
to be build.

Getting the sources.
--------------------

Change into the directory where you want the sources to reside and do:

    git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git 
    cd openwrt

Default feeds.
--------------

To have the standard set of packages available for OpenWRT copy 
`feeds.conf.default` to `feeds.conf`.

	cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf

Custom feeds.
-------------

*If you just want a web server, and do not need setuptools for Python 3,
or my shiny site generator, you can skip this step.*

I have made a couple of custom feeds, that addresses some specific
Python 3 needs I have for my [static site
generator](https://github.com/deadbok/ssg "Static Site Generator"). To
have these packages available add the following to ```feeds.conf```:

	src-git packages https://github.com/deadbok/packages.git
	src-git deadbok https://github.com/deadbok/deadbok-openwrt.git
	
Comment out the original package line in the file.


Update and add the feeds.
-------------------------

Add the packages to the build system.

	./scripts/feeds update -a
	./scripts/feeds install -a
    

Configuring the sources.
------------------------

You can download my [configuration file][Medion OX820 based NAS and Gentoo]($LOCALURL/openwrt-config),
and use it as a basis for your own configuration. 

To configure the OpenWRT build run `make menuconfig` in the  source
directory.



 
Adding custom packages.
=======================
*[OpenWRT wiki: OPKG Package Manager](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/opkg)*

I have chosen to compile most of the software I use, in this 
installation, as packages that must be installed after flashing the
static image.
Some of these packages are only installed for my own personal 
convenience, and some because they are needed for my [static site
generator](https://github.com/deadbok/ssg "Static Site Generator").


Serving packages for OpenWRT.
-----------------------------

Like when installing the bootstrap image you need a web server with
the package files available to OpenWRT. You could copy the package
files to the HDD, but I have not tried that. ```/etc/opkg.conf``` need
an adjustment to tell opkg (the package manager) where to find the
packages:

	dest root /
	dest ram /tmp
	lists_dir ext /var/opkg-lists
	option overlay_root /overlay
	src/gz base http://serverip/packages/base
	#src/gz telephony http://serverip/packages/telephony
	src/gz deadbok http://serverip/packages/deadbok
	src/gz packages http://serverip/packages/packages
	src/gz routing http://serverip/packages/routing
	src/gz luci http://serverip/packages/luci
	#src/gz management http://serverip/packages/management
	
Replace ```severip``` with the IP address of the computer serving the
packages.

Update the package index.

	opkg update


Installing required packages.
-----------------------------

*File systems:*

	opkg install kmod-fs-ext4 swap-utils opkg e2fsprogs
	modprobe ext4

*Web server:*

	opkg install ca-certificates
	opkg install lighttpd lighttpd-mod-accesslog lighttpd-mod-compress
	
 + ```lighttpd-mod-accesslog```: Log access to the web server to a file.
 + ```lighttpd-mod-compress```: Compress data before sending them to the client.


Installing the optional packages.
----------------------------------

These are just tools that are nice to have.
	
*File manager:*

	opkg install mc
	

*Easy editor*

	opkg install nano


*SFTP server:* 

	opkg install openssh-sftp-server


Installing packages for ssg.
-------------------------------

*Python 3:*

For some reason my package does not pull in the Python 3 dependency
correctly, therefore the package ```python3``` must be installed first.

	opkg install python3
	opkg install python3-setuptools


*Git:*

Links in ```/usr/libexec/git-core/``` are wrong, this is corrected by
creating the symlink, see [Bug #11930](https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11930).

	opkg install git
	ln -s $$(which git) /usr/libexec/git-core/git
	

Final configuration.
====================

System.
-------

*[System configuration](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system)*

Global configuration is done in `/etc/config/system`. I sent the logs to
a file on the HDD, and limited it at 1Mb in size. You should configure 
the host name and time zone to your local preferences.

The log levels of different subsystems is configured in this file as 
well. *Notice that for `conloglevel` and `klogconloglevel` a higher
number means more verbose, while for `cronloglevel` it is the other way
around.* 

I have not touched the time server configuration, I only use the client
part, and it worked out of the box.

	config system
			option hostname         OpenWRT
			option log_file         /mnt/data/log/messages
			option log_size         1024
			option log_type         file
			option timezone         Europe/Copenhagen
	#Log levels 1-8
	#Higher is more verbose
			option conloglevel      4
	#Lower is more verbose
			option cronloglevel     4

	config timeserver ntp
			list server             0.openwrt.pool.ntp.org
			list server             1.openwrt.pool.ntp.org
			list server             2.openwrt.pool.ntp.org
			list server             3.openwrt.pool.ntp.org
			option enabled          1
			option enable_server    0


Mount points.
-------------

*[Fstab Configuration](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/fstab)*

There are two "disks" in the system, the internal flash, and the HDD
connected to the SATA port.

 + ```/``` OpenWRT on the internal flash.
 + ```/mnt/data``` Root of the connected HDD.
 + ```/mnt/data/www``` Root of the pages served by lighttpd.
 + ```/mnt/data/log``` System log files.
 + ```/mnt/data/tmp``` Temporary files.

OpenWRT uses `/etc/config/fstab` to configure mount points.
 
	config global
		option	anon_swap	'0'
		option	anon_mount	'0'
		option	auto_swap	'1'
		option	auto_mount	'1'
		option	delay_root	'5'
		option	check_fs	'1'

The global section tells OpenWRT, to not mount any drives that do not
have their own section in fstab (anon_*). Auto_* to mount any file
system and swap space, from the fstab. Delay mounting for 5 seconds,
and perform a file system check if needed. 


	config mount
		option target 		'/mnt/data'
		option fstype 		'ext4'
		option options 		'rw,sync'
		option enabled 		'1'
		option device 		'/dev/sda2'
		option enabled_fsck	'1'
		
This section configures `/dev/sda2` as an ext4 partition with
read-write access, and mounts it at `/mnt/data`.
		
	config swap
		option device 		'/dev/sda3'
		option enabled 		'1'

Last is the swap space from `/dev/sda3'.

Create the mount point and mount the partitions.

	mkdir /mnt/data
	block mount
	
Create directories for web server, logs, and temporary files.

	mkdir /mnt/data/{www,log,tmp}



Adding users and groups.
------------------------

OpenWRT is not build to be a multiuser system, but it is possible to
configure it like that. There are two options, either use `shadow` like
a desktop Linux system, or use busybox build in user handling. I have
used the busybox version, since it is lighter.

User directories are kept on the HDD and linked into the root file
system.

	mkdir -p /mnt/data/home
	ln -sf /mnt/data/home /home

Users are added using the `adduser` command. Replace `username` with
the user name you want.

	adduser username

Next create the user directory and set the permissions.

	mkdir /mnt/data/home/username
	chown -R username /mnt/data/home/username
	chmod 700 /mnt/data/home/username

I still want root access, but I to log in as a regular user and `su` to
the root account, like a desktop system. Busybox needs some setup for 
the `su` command to work.
	
	chmod u+s /bin/busybox

`/etc/busybox.conf`

	[SUID]
	su = ssx root.root
	

Disabling root access from ssh.
-------------------------------

*[Dropbear Configuration](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dropbear)*

Now that `su` works, there is no reason to allow root access through 
ssh, if you do not need ssh it would be even better to disable it.


For non root access:
`/etc/config/dropbear`

	config dropbear
		option PasswordAuth 	'1'
		option RootPasswordAuth '0'
		option RootLogin		'0'
		option Port         	'22'

Disable ssh enterily:

	/etc/init.d/dropbear disable


File system permissions.
------------------------

Permissions for `/mnt/data/www/`, the directory served by lighttpd.

	chown http:www-data


Configuring lighttpd.
---------------------

*[Configuring Lighttpd](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/TutorialConfiguration)*,
*[Lighttpd Secure Web Server Tutorial](https://calomel.org/lighttpd.html)*

Configuration is done in `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf`:

	#Include the accesslog module to log web site access
	server.modules = ( "mod_accesslog" )

	#Root of the webserver is at /mnt/data/www
	server.document-root        = "/mnt/data/www"

	#Where uploaded files are stored	
	server.upload-dirs          = ( "/mnt/data/tmp" )

	#Where errors are logged
	server.errorlog             = "/mnt/data/log/lighttpd/error.log"
	#Process id 
	server.pid-file             = "/var/run/lighttpd.pid"

	#User and group that the server runs as
	server.username             = "http"
	server.groupname            = "www-data"

	#Use index.html if root is requested
	index-file.names            = ( "index.html" )
	#Disable auto index directory listings
	dir-listing.activate     = "disable"

	#Limit request method "POST" size in kilobytes (KB)
	server.max-request-size  = 1

	#Disable multi range requests
	server.range-requests    = "disable"

	#Disable symlinks
	server.follow-symlink    = "disable"

	#Debug options
	debug.log-file-not-found	= "enable"

	#Access log module
	accesslog.syslog-level		= "6"
	accesslog.filename 			= "/mnt/data/log/lighttpd/access.log"

	#Port to bind to
	server.port                 = 80

	include       "/etc/lighttpd/mime.conf"
	#include_shell "cat /etc/lighttpd/conf.d/*.conf"
	
I have disabled symlinks in this configuration, which means that the 
web root directory, cannot be a symlink. You will get something like 
`403 Forbidden` if you try. The same goes for symlinks inside the web
root directory, they won't work.

You can change this behavior by changing `server.follow-symlink = "disable"`
to `server.follow-symlink = "enable"`, but i encourage you to read
[this answer on Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/questions/244592/followsymlinks-on-apache-why-is-it-a-security-risk/244612#244612).


The Webalizer, web site statistiscs.
------------------------------------

To run `webalizer`, create a cron job for it in `/etc/crontab/http`, by
putting the jop in the `http` file, cron is told to run it as the `http`
user.

	0 */12 * * * /usr/bin/webalizer -q
	
Make the configuration file readable to all users.

	chmod a+r /etc/webalizer.conf

Create the directories, and set user `http`, group `www-data` as owner.
Make the directory writable by all members of the group `www-data`. This
is done so that both lighttpd and The Webalizer have permission to
access the files. 

	mkdir -p /mnt/data/www/stats/
	chown http:www-data /mnt/data/www/stats -R
	chmod g+w /mnt/data/www/stats -R
	
To not have search bots index the statistics, create a `/mnt/data/www/robots.txt` 
file with the following contents.

	User-agent: *
	Disallow: /stats


Other notes.
============

Installing an updated image.
----------------------------

*[OpenWrt Sysupgrade](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade)*

OpenWRT has a command, `sysupgrade`, that is used to upgrade the flash 
image from an update file. I have not been able to get this to work, and
have ended up installing LUCI, the web configuration interface, 
every time I need to update the root file system.

	opkg install luci
	
This opens another can of worms, since lighttpd is happily serving pages
on port 80, where LUCIs web server, [uHTTPd](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/http.uhttpd),
wants to be. To get around this, I told uHTTPd to use some other ports.
To do this, change the ports in the lines containing `listen` in
`/etc/config/uhttpd`, like so:

	config uhttpd 'main'
		list listen_http '0.0.0.0:8080'
		list listen_http '[::]:8080'
		list listen_https '0.0.0.0:4430'
		list listen_https '[::]:4430'

Then restart uHTTPd:

	/etc/init.d/uhttpd restart

LUCI will now be available on the current IP address, on port 8080 and
encrypted on 4430. Use the root user/password to login in, and use
`openwrt-oxnas-stg212-ubifs-sysupgrade.tar` to update the device.

After flashing the firmware, all packages need to be reinstalled. Opkg
will probably complain about changed config files, but this just means
our configuration changes have been kept.

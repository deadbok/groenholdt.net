Just noticed when writing this, that that all the subjects were, sort
of, biblical references. I hate to admit it, but I have been temporarily
diverted from my power supply project.

I have long been working on compiling an embedded Linux OS, myself, and
have been working on a tool for this, using `python`_, a language new to
me. The distribution is called `*EdenLinux*`_, and the tool is called
*distbuild*, it is sort of a Makefile template system. Check out the
whole thing `here`_.

It is apple season, and I have been baking different kinds of apple
pies. It became quite an obsession, to try the different possibilities,
and combine what I liked. I swore that the one I made last weekend would
be the last, but then I was given a bag of apples for free, and the one
currently in the oven, is destined to be the last :D.

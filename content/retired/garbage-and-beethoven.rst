| This has been quite a day. It has left me tired to the bone, even
though I don't know exactly, what I've accomplished to justify the
aching muscles.
|  I'm in the process of trying out the `Gentoo 2008.0\_beta1`_, things
are running quite smoothly, maybe helped by my favorite heavy metal
composer of all times, Beethoven. I was lucky enough to pickup a
"Deutsche Grammophon" LP box with all his symphonies, very cheap. Nice
to have them all on vinyl, in a box, where I can always find them (which
is a general problem in my home).
|  BUT Herbert von Karajan lacks a lot of respect for the finer details
of Beethoven, I think. It is as though he never understood the contrast
between the very loud, and sometimes violent burst of sheer energy, and
the hauntingly beautiful passages. He seems to just stride along in an
even tempo, never quite feeling the celestial peace of the symphony as a
whole (Don't flame me for describing Beethoven's music as peaceful).
These a good recordings, giving me the need, to find all the symphonies,
with a more suitable conductor.

Keeping in the spirit of music, someone had thrown out a perfectly fine
4 octave, pressure sensitive, drum and synth sounds from hell, keyboard,
that my daughter now very much enjoy. Damn, I was there to throw out an
immense load of old motherboards and stuff, and went back with a
keyboard... But I simply can't leave a musical instrument like that.
Interestingly enough my 4 year old daughter instinctively played on the
beat, when I started the built in drum beat punisher. Funny thing about
having children, even though the noises she made were almost unbearable,
I loved every minute of it.

title: Linux Mint 6 named after my daughter ;)
template: post


Seems the [Linux Mint 6 x64
edition](http://www.linuxmint.com/blog/?p=595), shares it's name with my
daughter, and what a lovely name it is. I'm a [Gentoo](http://) fanatic,
but have tried the Mint distribution on occasion, and it is really quite
nice.

I liked this concert quite a lot better than the one in Augustenborg
last year, I was a afraid of another bad experience. This time we were
right there up front. Since "the man" seems to have decided not to press
his PA, the closer you get, the more you can enjoy the experience of
really good sound quality. The band seemed to enjoy themselves, and so I
may have to revise my take on Roger Waters, being old, grumpy, and self
centered. I missed "The Pros and Cons of hitchhiking" though.

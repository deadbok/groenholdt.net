Just noticed when writing this, that that all the subjects were, sort
of, biblical references. I hate to admit it, but I have been temporarily
diverted from my power supply project.

I have long been working on compiling an embedded Linux OS, myself, and
have been working on a tool for this, using [python](http://python.org),
a language new to me. The distribution is called
[*EdenLinux*](http://code.google.com/p/eden-linux), and the tool is
called *distbuild*, it is sort of a Makefile template system. Check out
the whole thing [here](http://code.google.com/p/eden-linux).

It is apple season, and I have been baking different kinds of apple
pies. It became quite an obsession, to try the different possibilities,
and combine what I liked. I swore that the one I made last weekend would
be the last, but then I was given a bag of apples for free, and the one
currently in the oven, is destined to be the last :D.

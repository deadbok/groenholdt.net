title: Denon DCD-3560 resurrected
type: post


I have had this baby sitting on a shelf for a couple of years, getting
more and more sick, to the point where it would skip through a CD in
about 1 minute, very annoying. I needed something for my DAC to compete
against and tried the SONY CDP-228ESD I had around, this uses a SONY
digital filter and 2xPCM58P-J, but it was really no match, and I have
never liked the sound of the thing. I must say, that I like the
construction, this SONY, is surely made to be above average, but for me
it didn't do the trick sound wise.

Back to the DCD-3560, I tried the adjustment procedure outlined in the
service manual, with no success. So, back to the conclusion, that the
laser was dying, fast. The laser is a KSS151A, from SONY, and of course
out of production! Costing on the wrong side of 100EUR it wasn't really
an option to just buy a new one. Secondly, things are a little more
complicated with the KSS151A than a most other lasers I have seen,
throwing out a lot of money, only to wreck the player completely, didn't
seem like the way to go Until

I realised, that the SONY machine had the same laser, unfortunately,
this means, that I've killed it, not in cold blood, but still the SONY
is now very dead. After sweating 5 litres of nervous sweat, loosing a
screw in the actuator, and readjusting the DCD-3560, which by the way,
went smother with the new laser. The tracking gain was impossible to get
right, with the old laser. Well the DCD-3560 is running smoothly again.
Now there is nothing to do but hope the laser will last a long time.
